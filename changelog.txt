** 0.3.0.1 -> 0.4.0.0
 - deepseq-bounded major version bump again (OverloadedStrings! yummy)
 - there'll be two or three of these over the next month or so, then
   thing'll likely get pretty quiet

0.3.0.0 -> 0.3.0.1
 - still trying to decide on policy regarding cpphs
 - this is all motivated by one pesky rogue anonymous build spammer
 - had a spot of trouble over this, but learned a few tricks
 - hopefully this upload is the ticket; sorry for the extra version uploads

** 0.2.1.1 -> 0.3.0.0
 - deepseq-bounded major version bump

0.2.1.0 -> 0.2.1.1
 - added a non-manual USE_CPPHS flag to seqaid.cabal, which should
   in principle allow the client build system to try cpphs first, and
   if that build fails, then try again with a native cpp if there's
   one in the path (which is usually the case)
    - this auto-toggle works for me with GHC 7.8.4 and Cabal 1.22.0.0
    - what is the oldest version of cabal-install that this
      auto-toggling will happen in?...
 - improvements in platform-dependent handling in Demo.hs
 - and also in choice of leaky version in Demo.hs

0.2.0.0 -> 0.2.1.0
 - realised I should be using Manual: True in all my .cabal flags,
   or else the constraint solver is free to toggle them!!

** 0.1.7.0 -> 0.2.0.0
 - deepseq-bounded had a major version bump
 - fixed cpphs missing dependency (Seqaid lib, and seqaid and seqaidpp exe's)
 - more...
