Is the <tt>leaky</tt> Example Contrived?
</h3>

Some words may be in order about where <tt>seqaid</tt> and <tt>leaky</tt> came from, and how this all fits together.
<tt>seqaid</tt> was the first of this group of projects, started in June (2014).
At that time, it was a GHC API application, and there&rsquo;s been a fair amount of water under the bridge since then.
In July I conceived of <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt> based on considerations while pushing <tt>seqaid</tt>.
August I was on hiatus, then finished <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt>, but wanted to see if I could plug it in to <tt>seqaid</tt> and maybe release them together.

<p>
Up till then, I&rsquo;d been using <tt>Anatomy</tt> as my main space leak example, but it stopped leaking in GHC 7.8.1 (if not earlier).
<!-- hide/show
I was also unaccountably unable to get it to leak for me anymore with GHC 7.6.3, and I still don&rsquo;t understand...
(It&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a path problem this time!)
-->
I needed a good, robust space leak example to test my work on.

<p>
At the same time, I was dissatisfied with <tt>seqaid</tt> as a GHC API executable, because I wanted something more seamless to the user, like GHC plugins.
So I foolishly went down a very deep rabbit hole to re-write <tt>seqaid</tt> as a GHC plugin, which finally was only possible by also using Template Haskell <em>and</em> a text-level (regex) pre-processor (GHC -F option).
It is seamless to the user, but the code is quite a bit less elegant than the GHC API executable.
(Which wasn&rsquo;t elegant to begin with.)
<!-- hide/show
In retrospect I should have spent that effort making the GHC API executable work as a stand-in for GHC, so in your project .cabal file you&rsquo;d specify seqaid as an alternative compiler.
Oh well.
Probably discussion will help decide the best future course.
-->
I don&rsquo;t regret learning TH and Core, and the several other things learned on this adventure.
But I would not recommend programming in Core unless you really need to, or you know (really know) that what you need to do is well-supported that late in the compilation pipeline.

<p>
So, I was making adventures into GHC plugins, and I needed a dependable leak example.
<!-- hide/show
I guess that was September.
September/October was a bit disrupted, as I moved across the country, but then had a funeral to return for.
-->
What I did was take my most recent GHC (7.8.1), and try to write a small program that exhibited a space leak, because I didn&rsquo;t have a single small example, although I have numerous large ones. :)
I documented this process (I always keep a play-by-play text file with any project or subproject), but I won&rsquo;t review it now.
Suffice it to say, <tt>leaky</tt> was designed to resemble a &ldquo;real-world program&rdquo;, in the choice of data types, and in the &ldquo;steady-state, long-running&rdquo; behaviour, with data accumulation/transmutation.
I didn&rsquo;t rest until I had it leaking with GHC 7.8.1 under -O2, even with all strict fields in the data structures.
(It still leaks in 7.8.4 and <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.10.1-rc1/">7.10.1-rc1</a>.)

<p>
During that battle of wits with the compiler, I wasn&rsquo;t really thinking about <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt> or <tt>seqaid</tt>, so the leak example was not contrived with these tools in mind (although they already existed, particularly <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt> which was finished).

<p>
Now that I had a leak example, I was ready to test my leak-plugging tools.
I added a deep list to the state, so that while <tt>NFData</tt>/<tt>force</tt> could be used to plug the leak, it incurred an arbitrarily-large performance hit.
In this respect, there was some contrivance, as I wanted to show how <tt>NFDataN</tt> could outperform <tt>NFData</tt> when used in a similar manner.
Then of course I wanted to show how <tt>NFDataP</tt> could outperform them both.
I adorned the state with some large strict blobs, which <tt>NFDataN</tt> cannot avoid, but <tt>NFDataP</tt> can.
The optimal forcing pattern used with <tt>NFDataP</tt> was hand-written.
To date, the optimiser part of <tt>seqaid</tt> is planned but still unimplemented.

<p>
I think the example is valid (realistic), notwithstanding these contrivances.
There hasn&rsquo;t been time yet to put the new tools to work on my real projects.
<tt>seqaid</tt> in particular is just breaking out of its shell.
I&rsquo;ll be reporting progress as it becomes feasible.

<p>
The following shows the output of <tt>seqaid</tt> with <tt>leaky</tt>.
It is also a wee bit contrived, as I sweep <tt>NFDataN</tt> <tt><em>N</em></tt> value to a fixed depth, and then the fixed (hand-optimised) pattern is developed by replaying iterated <tt>shrinkPat</tt> in reverse.
But it does illustrate the sorts of effects possible, once <tt>seqaid</tt> has an optimiser.

A sort of <a href="extra2.html">commentary</a> on the change history is on a separate page.

<h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Remarks</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can see the space leak as a steady, substantial growth in the heap size, from <tt><em>N</em></tt> equal 0 through 5, and again in the first five pattern lines.
<li>You can see the first large, strict blobs get hit at a depth of 5 (with <tt>forcen</tt>).
<li>Unfortunately :) it is not until a depth of 6 that the leak can be plugged. (Well, you can plug it without forcing the spine, using let-lifting, but <tt>seqaid</tt> doesn&rsquo;t do that yet.) So <tt>NFDataN</tt> is not a feasible solution for this leak.
<li><tt>NFDataP.forcep</tt> successfully plugs the leak without hitting the big strict blobs.
<li>This output doesn&rsquo;t show how <tt>NFData</tt> would perform worse, but for large <tt><em>N</em></tt> there is additional penalty due to the presence of some long lists (not strict, but deep) in the state.
<!--<li>It may appear there is still a slight leak in the heap, with the final pattern, but if the run is extended, this space is reclaimed periodically.
I don&rsquo;t quite understand this, since I am using <tt>performGC</tt> before each stats line is printed, but the fact is there is no longitudinal net growth.
(Oops, I don&rsquo;t see it in this paste anyways...).-->
