<h3 style="margin-top: 12px; color: #666;">Space Leak Diagnostic and Remedial Tool</h3>

If you&rsquo;re reading this, you probably don&rsquo;t need to be told that <span class="nowrap">space leak is</span> the bane of lazy languages like Haskell.

<!-- http://neilmitchell.blogspot.ca/2013/11/acm-article-leaking-space.html -->
Quoting <span class="nowrap">briefly from</span> <span class="nowrap">Neil Mitchell&rsquo;s 2013</span> <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2538488">article</a> in <em>ACM Queue</em>:

<p>
<em style="display: block; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 100px;">
<p>
&ldquo;[Writers of] compilers for lazy functional languages have been dealing with space leaks for more than 30 years and have developed a number of strategies to help.
...
Despite all the improvements, space leaks remain a thorn in the side of lazy evaluation, producing a significant disadvantage to weigh against the benefits.&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Pinpointing space leaks is a skill that takes practice and perseverance. Better tools could significantly simplify the process.&rdquo;
</em>

<p>

Seqaid (package <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/seqaid">seqaid</a> on hackage) is a tool to help debug <span class="nowrap">space leak</span> <span class="nowrap">in Haskell</span> projects.

<p>

The key contribution of <!--a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/seqaid"-->seqaid<!--/a--> is runtime strictness optimisation, through dynamic, principled forcing, as supported by <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/deepseq-bounded"><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></a>.

<p>

This package consists of
<ul>
<a id="r1"></a>
<li>a GHC plugin (to automate the instrumentation of modules)
<li>a small library (used by the plugin; or for manual instrumentation)
</ul>

<p>

Seqaid can auto-plug many <span>leaks.&nbsp;<a href="#1">[1]</a></span>
<!--But there&rsquo;s still many it cannot help you with, at least without some coaxing on your part.-->
However, not all leaks can be addressed by adding strictness;
and, although most can (in my experience), usually these could also be addressed by refactoring in such a way that no added strictness was required.
It may be that clues to such refactorings are offered by observation of optimal forcing patterns.

<p>

I believe that seqaid has potential to be a useful resource, but this is only a bare-bones first-version.
<a id="r2"></a>
The ultimate goal would be to see some evolution of this make it into compilers (perhaps even the GHC RTS), supposing a better solution hasn&rsquo;t arrived first.

<p>

Seqaid is more general-purpose than just a space leak tool.
It contains TH and GHC plugin code to <span>automatically&nbsp;<a href="#2">[2]</a></span>
instrument Haskell packages with an arbitrary wrapper function around select expressions.
There&rsquo;s nothing (much) to stop you from substituting your own wrapper functions.
When the dust settles here, I should probably try to split off a wrapper-agnostic auto-instrumentation tool.
<p>
We do not have the luxury of changing the types of the functions we&rsquo;re instrumenting, so passing extra state in any pure way is out of the question.
In seqaid specifically, per-call-site data is maintained by judicious use of unsafe <tt>IORef</tt> operations.
<!-- However, there are no safety implications in this case, as proven elsewhere. <a href="#3">[3]</a>&nbsp; -->
The unsafe operations are no more dangerous than <tt>seq</tt> (no matter how wrong things go).
<a id="r3"></a>
But it is true that, technically, program semantics can be affected by strictification:
Adding strictness to a program may introduce bottoms (in addition to any that might already be lurking).
<p>
<a id="using"></a>
Happily, although <tt>seq</tt> breaks free theorems, <span>seqaid&nbsp;does&nbsp;not.&nbsp;<a href="#3">[3]</a></span>

<!--You can do any IO you wish via manual instrumentation.-->

<h3><red>OLD</red> (June 2014) Combing Out Global DeepSeq</h3>

Control.DeepSeq and related generics/TH modules are a great tool for debugging space leaks, and also a great temptation for evading them.
A common strategy is to start at a high level in leaking code (in the sense of high in the parse tree), finding a place where a forcing function will squash your leaks, and then working the forcer further down until the offending code has been discovered.
For didactic purposes, let&rsquo;s suppose your forcing function is deepseq.
Sometimes more than one site will have leaky code, so as the deepseq is moved down, it may have to be duplicated and branch out as well.
<p>
It would be nice to automate this process of refining the locations of deepseq.
Something simple that should work is a binary partitioning of descendant expressions, into those which propagate the deepseq, and those which do not.
Auto-recompilation and auto-profile-analysis can determine whether the change maintains leak-free behaviour, guiding the search for the smallest expressions which need forcing.
The developer may prefer to force at a higher level, in case this minimal set is highly ramified (high cardinality), but mostly we&rsquo;re interested in those expressions deepest in the parse tree that, forced, suffice to staunch the leak.

<p>

The <a href="index.html">Heaply</a> page has more info on a nascent implementation.

-->

<p>

<h3>Dynamically Configurable Parallelism</h3>

With recent upgrades to <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt>, (the) dynamically-configurable parallelisation harness now comes for free, and should also prove useful.
The strictness harness machinery of seqaid will work without change for this purpose, including the optimiser, and promises some interesting experiments!

<h3>How to Use Seqaid</h3>

A good introduction to using seqaid is generated by running <tt>seqaid demo</tt>.
This will create a fresh, uniquely-named subdirectory in the current directory, and populate it with a sample project (<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/leaky">leaky</a>), build it with seqaid auto-instrumentation in effect, and run it.
The <tt>README</tt> file in the generated directory has more information about the meaning of the output.
<!--The <tt>leaky.cabal</tt> file in the generated directory shows how to configure the plugin.-->
<a id="r4"></a>

<p>

Note the file <tt>seqaid.config</tt>, a small text file with a very simple format which you write to control seqaid.
Here is the <tt>seqaid.config</tt> file for leaky:

<pre>
package    leaky
module     Main
  binds    duty
    types  Types.TA
instances  Types.TA, Types.TB, Types.TC
</pre>

<p>
This file instructs the seqaid preprocessor to build with a conditional forcing wrapper (strictness harness) for all subexpressions of type <tt>TA</tt> occurring in the equations of the bind <tt>duty</tt> in module <tt>Main</tt>.
It furthermore instructs seqaid to automatically derive necessary instances for instrumenting user-defined data types <tt>Types.TA</tt> <span>etc.&nbsp;<a href="#4">[4]</a></span>
<!--
Note the file <tt>SeqaidTypes.hs</tt>, which is a stub you need to create, with imports of all types you want to be able to force through.
(Most common types already have <tt>NFDataP</tt> instances provided, similar to <tt>NFData</tt>.)
The actual meta-boilerplate to derive <tt>NFDataP</tt> instances of your types is auto-generated, which is perhaps a first for generic deriving support!
The <tt>SeqaidTypes.hs</tt> stub, and the plugin options in the <tt>.cabal</tt> file, are the only edits required to use seqaid on your own project.
-->

<p>

Besides the <tt>seqaid.config</tt> file, all that is needed to use seqaid on your own project are some additions to the .cabal file.
This includes some extra dependencies (notably, seqaid; possibly a few others; Cabal will let you know), and the following GHC options:

<pre>
  ghc-options: -fplugin=Seqaid.Plugin
               -F -pgmF seqaidpp
               -XTemplateHaskell
               -with-rtsopts=-T
</pre>

<p>
Manual instrumentation is also supported, should you prefer.
Simply wrap any expressions you&rsquo;d like in harness with a <tt>seqaid</tt> application.
Although <tt>seqaid</tt> is not an actual function, from the user&rsquo;s perspective it must be treated as if it was, in the fixity/associativity context of each call site.
For technical reasons <span style="font-size: 80%">[no good reason really...]</span>, this presently also requires adding a <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/seqaid/docs/Seqaid-Ann.html#t:SeqaidAnnManual"><tt>SeqaidAnnManual</tt></a> annotation for each bind you edit.
<!--span style="font-size: 80%;">[That document is still not written, but <tt>leaky</tt> at <tt>FORCING_STRATEGY=4</tt> is a demonstation.]</span-->

<h3>Leaky Contrived to Showcase Seqaid?</h3>

Some words about the derivation of leaky are <a href="extra.html">here</a>, where the output of seqaid applied to leaky is also discussed.

<h3>Work in Progress...</h3>

<div id="dig01" class="digression" style="margin-left: 20px;">
<a id="dig01h" style="margin-bottom: -15px;" class="dig-toggle-hide" href='javascript:toggle("dig01");'>Hide</a><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
I&rsquo;m just fretting that I should have investigated using a GHC API app as a GHC replacement instead, if by chance it can be done light-weight.
Well, at worst the GHC program is only a bit over 1 MB in size.
Er ... but compiling it is a serious build, this is not like any old cabal install from hackage...
But also, it seems GHC API can be used with TH.
The problem seems to be that due to staging restrictions you still cannot modify existing declarations this way.
Best bet is really some plugin facility between Parser and Renamer/TC.
</div>
<p>
Most all the work up till now has been to get the basic infrastructure in place.
I hustled this preliminary version of seqaid together in the wake of writing the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/deepseq-bounded"><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></a> library, just as proof of concept.
Unfortunately, auto-instrumentation turned out to be a nightmare, particularly as I had no TH or Core programming experience, setting me back by more than a month...

<p>
So I&rsquo;ve determined to release <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/leaky">leaky</a>, <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/deepseq-bounded"><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></a>, and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/seqaid">seqaid</a> without further delay.

<p>
After a much-needed vacation from these topics (which are not my interest; I&rsquo;m an applications programmer!...), there are a few more things I&rsquo;m intending to do.

<p>
<a style="display: none;" id="dig02s" class="dig-toggle-show" href='javascript:toggle("dig02");'>Show</a>
<div style="display: inline-block;" id="dig02" class="digression" style="margin: 20px 100px 0px 30px;">
<a style="display: block; margin-bottom: -15px;" id="dig02h" class="dig-toggle-hide" href='javascript:toggle("dig02");'>Hide</a><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
From this point on (including note <a href="#3">[3]</a>), I may be talking nonsense in places.<br />
I&rsquo;ll ammend this preliminary stuff subject to discussion and new learning.
</div>

<h4>Immediate priorities</h4>

Two necessary things are still pending:

<ul>
<li>
Dynamic optimisation of forcing patterns (easy, from here).
<li>
Exploiting heap entity info (perhaps via <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-heap-view">ghc-heap-view</a>).
</ul>

<h4>Other issues and plans</h4>

<ul>
<!--
<li>
Seqaid currently wraps whole RHS&rsquo;s of declarations.
This is ineffectual for monadic functions.
Monadic functions can be manually instrumented by wrapping ("injecting at") subexpressions.
Getting demand propagation right might be tricky.
As for automating, the plugin already handles lambdas differently than other expressions, so monadic expressions could also be given special accomodation.
-->
<li>
No performance tuning has been done yet.
We need to see if it pays to run the plugin after the Core-to-Core optimisation phase &mdash; running it earlier may well interfere with GHC optimisation tactics.
<li>
There are a few desperate <tt>String/Regex</tt> hacks, at least some of which can probably be solved without resorting to that.
<li>
For top-level bind harnessing, seqaid currently issues a warning for (and omits wrapping of) any declaration having polymorphic type.
These can however be manually instrumented.
Working on automating for polymorphic types...
This has become less of an issue with subexpression injection.
<li>
It is possible to transform away the <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt> code generated by seqaid, leaving only <tt>let</tt> and <tt>seq</tt>.
If you were to accept a (constant) strictification offered by seqaid, you could emit it as a static <tt>let</tt>-and-<tt>seq</tt> code transformation.
The point is, if your code was Haskell 98 to begin with, it will still be Haskell 98 afterwards, and also be significantly more performant than the high-level forcing harness of seqaid.
<br />

There is nothing intrinsically non-H98 about <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt>, but for generic deriving support GHC is needed.
You could write your own <tt>NFDataP</tt> and superclass instances, and be H98 all the way.
<tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt> can be built in H98 mode with the flag <tt>HASKELL98_FRAGMENT</tt>...
</div>
<li>
There is rich mathemetical structure underlying strictness manipulation (see for instance
<a href="http://www.fremissant.net/deepseq-bounded/deepseq-bounded.html#fusion">fusion rules</a> in <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt>, and the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/deepseq-bounded/docs/Control-DeepSeq-Bounded-PatUtil.html">PatUtil</a> API; or, for more theoretical depth, the many articles published over the last 50 years on abstract interpretation, demand propagation, strictness analysis, evaluation transformers...).
Whether before or after transforming to <tt>let</tt>-and-<tt>seq</tt>, there are opportunities for simplifying the forcing harness, while preserving strictness and value semantics.
</ul>

<h4>Maybe...</h4>

It would be interesting to see whether instrumentation could be pushed further down the compilation pipeline, or even implemented "from the other side" in the RTS.
We might say that RTS can perform reciprocal injection,
and think of this as another level of injection deferral.

<p>
But the RTS is not a compilation stage of your code;
it is a virtual machine (mostly written in C) which evaluates your code, so implementing seqaid in the RTS will probably be quite a departure from the above.

<p>
The new <tt>Seqable</tt> module of <tt><span class="nowrap">deepseq-bounded</span></tt> is a step in the right direction, but I&rsquo;ve not had time to really investigate it let alone document it.

<p>
And anyway, it turns out <tt>seq</tt> is completely desugared by the time it hits the simplifier, so we&rsquo;re dealing with Core <tt>let</tt> versus <tt>case</tt> antics, and not even function applications.

LATER: See writings in /work/Projects/MiniProjects/Metaboiler/000-readme.
I&rsquo;ve looked into it, and basically, yes we can avoid ALMOST all user edits to intrumentation target source modules.
But if you have datatypes involved, and they don&rsquo;t have instances for Typeable, Data, and Generic, you will have to add these to the deriving clauses.
<p>
Or, better, add a single file importing all the types you need in instrumented code, and use -XStandaloneDeriving to "top them up" with instances.
Then you only need to add this import to your instrumentation target source modules.
And, as the preprocessor can inject imports, you need only provide the name as an argument to the preprocessor (or use a standard, fixed "Seqaid..." name), so actually STILL NO EDITS (excepting preprocessor) ARE NEEDED TO ANY ORIGINAL SOURCE FILES. Whew! It seems like there is always a way out...
<p>
All this is only needed for the <tt>deriveGeneric ''T</tt> for your types <tt>T</tt>.
But we cannot avoid the user having to add at least the "deriving instance" lines for their types, because TH cannot splice a "deriving instance" (-XStandaloneDeriving) to date (and TH cannot add/augment "deriving" clauses of existing types). [It looks like it&rsquo;s just coming down the pipes however.]
<p>
[Old sentences, used to be in body of document:]
The TH and Core (plugin) code work in tandem to make this possible, with the addition of two lines of code to each module the user wants instrumented.
And these two lines are both constants, and can safely be automatically inserted by an editing script.
(There&rsquo;s no way to do that with the GHC tools, that I know of. -F -pgmF -optF, but still isn&rsquo;t there some issue about temp files? I seem to recall from FreeSect...)

</ul>

We avoid this problem entirely, because seqaid never modifies the original source code:
generic strictifying code is injected during compilation, and then configured dynamically.
Thus there is no impediment to program transformation based on free theorems.
Since parts of the GHC simplifier depend on free theorems, it is necessary to inject seqaid instrumentation after these optimisation phases.
This also seems to indicate the desireability of an RTS solution.
<p>
Of course, FT transformations may affect the space use behaviour of your program, resulting in shifts in optimal forcing patterns, like rocks tumbling in the freshet will shift the rapids.
If performance tuning was your game, you could even turn the tide and use feedback from seqaid to search for optimising transformations...
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
In case you are somehow able to perform your transformations at runtime, even that is no problem.
You don&rsquo;t even need to turn off the plugin!
The forcing harness can be made truly transparent
<!-- (<em>i.e.</em>&nbsp;not a single <tt>seq</tt> introduced) -->
by simply asking it, dynamically and selectively, to lay off while you <span>transform.&nbsp;<a href="#r3">&#8682;</a></span>

The instances required are some subset of <tt>Typeable</tt>, <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop">SOP</a> <tt>Generic</tt>, and <tt>NFDataP</tt> and superclasses, and the exact set currently depends on Cabal flags.
<p>
Another point to note about the seqaid preprocessor concerns inlining.
GHC inlines very aggressively, even across module boundaries.
If you&rsquo;ve requested instrumentation of bind <tt>duty</tt>, but somehow <tt>duty</tt> is inlined before the Core plugin runs, the expressions you hoped to harness will slip through the net.
If you can afford a complete (blanket) harness, this problem will never arise, as it has to be inlined <em>somewhere</em>!
Another possible solution would be to have TH add a <tt>NOINLINE</tt> pragma to any binds mentioned in <tt>seqaid.config</tt>;
but weakening the inlining powers of a functional language compiler is generally a bad idea &mdash; not just for the function call overhead: it blocks potential optimisations at the call site.
So both of these solutions come at a performance cost, but both guarantee your fish will go to <span>market.&nbsp;<a href="#r4">&#8682;</a></span>
